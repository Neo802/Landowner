# Landowner 🧑‍🌾
My first Java project, now available on Git!

Summary:
A landowner can own multiple plots of land. The shape of the land can be a square, rectangle, circle or triangle. The
owner can acquire new plots or get rid of them. You also need to compute the total land area owned by the landowner.
